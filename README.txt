Project: A Peer Assessment Application
--------------------------------------

Description:

The Peer Assessment Application is designed for university team projects, allowing students to evaluate their teammates based on key performance dimensions. This system promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback to students and instructors on team dynamics and individual contributions.


Key Features:

1. Student Assessment: Students assess their teammates anonymously on a 7-point scale across four dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The evaluation promotes honest feedback and helps improve team performance.
- Cooperation: Participation in meetings, communication, assistance, and volunteering.
- Conceptual Contribution: Research, idea generation, and identification of difficulties.
- Practical Contribution: Report writing, reviewing others' work, and organizational contributions.
- Work Ethic: Attitude, respect for teammates, deadlines, and commitments.

2. Automated Score Sharing and Feedback: After submissions, scores are aggregated, and anonymous peer feedback is shared with students. Instructors receive detailed reports of individual and team performance.

3. Instructor Dashboard: Instructors can manage teams and access detailed peer assessment results by team and student. Data can also be exported as CSV files for further analysis.
